    <h4>Solute Tracer Data Repository</h4>

    <p>River corridors connect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, allowing interactions between hydrological, biological, and chemical processes. It is crucial to understand how water moves in river corridors. We use tracers, such as a dyes or salts, to track changes in concentration over time at downstream locations. The combined concentration and time data are called breakthrough curves (BTCs) and are the most common methods for observing solute transport in rivers and understanding water flow and storage.</p>
    <p>This database is comprised of compiled stream tracer data, breakthrough curves, hydraulic, hydrogeomorphic, and location data available in the literature. With this database we are starting to gather the wealth of information from researchers around the globe to allow scientists to contextualize their experiments on a broader scale and explore potential scaling relationships, similarities, and differences in river corridors across latitudes, ecological biomes, stream orders, and contrasting discharge. We will grow the database with further research contributions.</p>
    <p>The data is stored on HYDROSHARE as a SQL database and searchable via this User Interface or on HYDROSHARE with the CUAHSI JupyterHub. Reach out to use via the link below if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions.</p>
